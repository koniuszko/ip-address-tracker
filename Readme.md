# Frontend Mentor Challenge - IP Address Tracker

This repository contains my solution to the IP Address Tracker challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge involved
building a web application that allows users to track the location of an IP address. I used React and React Leaflet
along with external APIs to complete this project. The main goal of this project was to use interactive map components.

## Features

- User-friendly interface to enter and search for IP addresses.
- Display of the location details, such as country, region, and city, based on the provided IP address.
- Interactive map that visualizes the location of the IP address.
- Integration with external APIs to retrieve location data based on the IP address.

## Demo

You can see a live demo of the project [here](https://tangerine-kitten-a7c2eb.netlify.app).

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/koniuszko/ip-address-tracker.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Leaflet: A React library for integrating Leaflet maps into the application.
- External API: Utilized to fetch location data based on the provided IP address.

## API Usage

The project utilizes an external API to retrieve location data based on the provided IP address or domain name. The API
used in this project is [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org). The API is free to use, but it requires
signing up for an account to obtain an API key. The API key is then used to authenticate the requests.
